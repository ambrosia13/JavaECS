# JavaECS

A simple ECS I've been working on. As of this writing, it still needs a lot of work, and the performance is much lower than it could be. I don't recommend this for production use, nor do I guarantee it will ever be suitable for production use. However, I do intend to keep on improving it, and once I get the basic design completely set up, I will start focusing on performance.
